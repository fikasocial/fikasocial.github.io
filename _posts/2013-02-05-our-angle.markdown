We've chosen a name and have started to work out our angle. There has been a substantial change in the industry over the last couple of years and whereas Starbucks, Costa etc would have been seen at the forefront of the coffee market these are now being surpassed by a 'third wave' suppliers.

Customers have higher expectations and are more discerning. They are better informed and interested in the provenance of the products and localisation.

Our challenge is to provide our customers with an exceptional product in a great environment. I want our customers to enjoy Fika Social and create great memories every time they visit us.

Our goal is to make exceptional coffee and to do that we need to source great beans and great baristas.

In preparation I have 'cupped' at several roasters and tried an awful lot of cake. In the pursuit of excellence no bean or cake has been left untasted.
