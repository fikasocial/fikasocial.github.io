Earlier this year I was made redundant. It's a difficult thing but after 25 years in retail I pretty much saw it coming.

I have been very lucky really, working in Europe and The USA for some great smaller companies and some of the blue chip big ones.

I think I have worked at every level from Saturday part timer to Head of Retail and my two favourite roles were with Starbucks and Whittard of Chelsea.

For some people redundancy is a traumatic experience but for me it is turning into an opportunity to be my own boss and fulfil my dream of owning my coffee shop and retail outlet.

This blog will follow my progress in building and opening my coffee shop in Bristol.

Step 1 The Name

 I sat down one day and wrote down pretty much every coffee based pun name that I could think of. I was really proud and thought maybe I should pursue a future in marketing or advertising instead.

To test my new found marketing prowess I sat down and googled them all and low and behold some evil doers had got there before me and stole all my names. To the point where a coffee shop opened in Bristol that very week with one of the names I had chosen!

So back to the drawing board, I started to think of different names and places where I had enjoyed great coffee and food that had created lasting memories for me.

I have been really lucky and travelled extensively enjoying great coffee from Latin America to Indonesia but the one coffee culture that stood out for me was a little closer to home in Sweden.

Maybe coffee tastes better coming in from -11 degrees or looking out across The Archipelago but my fondest coffee moments are Swedish. They even have a name for it. Fika! To Fika (Feekah) means literally to go for a coffee break.

It was perfect an unusual name; easy to remember (hopefully) but it describes the ethos behind how I want my business to be.

My partner pointed out that Fika is very coffee driven and after all we wanted to appeal to everyone even the 'tea' people. Lol. So maybe we should add in something a little 'social'. So we did and the new business was born and will be called Fika Social.

I googled enthusiastically and researched Websites, Twitter,  and Facebook. With no doubt they all were available and in one big electronic swoop I bagged them all and registered the company at Companies House.
