From the start I have had a clear picture of what I wanted Fika Social to be about. 

Getting the interior of the site will be very important but I know from experience it doesn't matter how comfortable the seats are if you make lousy coffee.

I have tried where possible to resource all suppliers locally and am lucky to say there are some great roasters, bakers and pastry chefs in Bristol to ensure their are tempting products to enhance everyones visit.

I even have a local supplier for Fika products from a local group of Stockholmers who have relocated to the sunny South West of England.
